An agent came to me recently and asked how they could sharpen their skills for working with investors. So many agents out there get caught in the headlights when working with investors simply because they’re not used to it. There is different terminology to know, and it can be overwhelming when you specialize in working with buyers or sellers. Here are a few helpful tips to help you work with investors:

**1\. Understand investor goals.** Find out if cash flow or long-term appreciation is more important to them. Having a plan to help them evaluate an investment based on those parameters is important, too.

**2\. Know your terminology.** Like I said, some different terms come along with investments that aren't used in residential sales that you need to know. We pulled together a quick list of key terms like cap rate, cash-on-cash-return, and more. You can view it in full here.

If you have any questions for me about working with investors or about the business in general, don't hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
