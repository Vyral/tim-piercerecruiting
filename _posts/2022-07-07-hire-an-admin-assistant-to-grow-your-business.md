At what point in your real estate business should you hire an administrative assistant? From personal experience, I knew that&nbsp; I should have done it sooner, but my self-limiting beliefs held me back. I kept worrying about the financial obligations involved and how to train someone to properly help me with my business.&nbsp;

If you’re in the same place, I encourage you to get these things out of your head and realize that you have to stop working for $15 to $20 an hour, so you can **focus on the most productive activities in your business**. For those who are already successful, you’re most probably long overdue to hire an administrative assistant.&nbsp;

To help you identify what you should do and what you could potentially delegate out, I included a document called Delegate and Elevate in this blog. It’s an easy and quick exercise that will put things into perspective.&nbsp;

In business, nobody does it by themselves. You have to bring somebody to help you move forward. If you want to schedule a chat with me to talk about how you can hire an administrative assistant, don’t hesitate to shoot me an email. I’ll be happy to help\!
