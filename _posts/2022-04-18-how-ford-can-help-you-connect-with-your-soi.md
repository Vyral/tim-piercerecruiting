Are you calling your past clients and sphere as often as you should? Are you even calling them at all?&nbsp;

We’ve had this conversation on our team, and there are agents out there who would rather talk to a brand-new cold lead who doesn’t know them than a past client or referral.&nbsp;

Why? They don’t know what to say. If you’re having the same problem, I present to you the FORD script. **It stands for family, occupation, recreation, and dreams.** A lot of real estate coaches will tell you to ask for a referral every time you talk to someone in your sphere, but that’s not for me.&nbsp;

**I’m going to ask for referrals from time to time, but I’m always going to ask them about FORD.** Listen when you talk to your clients, and if the opportunity to ask for business presents itself, do so. The worst they can do is say they aren’t buying or selling right now.&nbsp;

Be authentic, listen to your clients, and most importantly, make the calls. They’ll appreciate it more than you know. If you have any questions for me, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
