Here at the Peirce Group, we have an extensive onboarding and fast-track program that is designed for both new agents just entering the industry and experienced agents looking to take their business to the next level.&nbsp;

**You’ll go through three weeks of in-person, boot-camp-style training** over topics like buyer consultations, showings, open houses, and everything else you need to get off the ground quickly.&nbsp;

After that three-week boot camp, we move you into the fast track. It is meant to be simply a fast track to your career. We’ll hold you accountable for the number of people you talk to. This will help build your pipeline and close homes quicker. You’ll also get to familiarize yourself with the community and learn through things like mock contracts. **We’ll prepare you for every single situation you might run into.&nbsp;**

Our onboarding and fast-track process will bring you more success than you ever thought you could achieve. If you have any questions or are interested in joining the team, please call or email us. We’d love to hear from you.
