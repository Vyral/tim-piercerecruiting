One of the top agents in the Peirce Group came to me the other day, telling me that he had a buyer who was freaking out about an inspection and wanted out of the deal. How did we fix it? Today I’ll share how we handled this precarious situation.

**The question was whether the buyer wanted to back out because of the inspection or because they had buyer’s remorse.** Later, we learned that it was in fact buyer’s remorse. We learned something very tactical from this experience: You need to talk about buyer’s remorse with your clients right after they go under contract.

I often say something to the effect of, “Now that you’ve signed this contract, you might go home and lose sleep over it. Most people do\! It’s a very simple thing called buyer’s remorse, and it’s usually the worst on the second and third days after going under contract.”

**Make sure to add that your clients should come to you when they’re having these feelings.** Remind them that you’re here for them throughout the process, and set expectations with them upfront so that you can help them navigate the emotional aspects of the process as well. There’s nothing more impactful than telling a story about how you’ve had buyer’s remorse yourself at some point; show them that you know how they feel and that you know to move forward through it. In the end, don’t let one excuse allow a contract to go under. Most of the time, it’s not actually because of the excuse they give you.

If you have any questions or need help in navigating your own client’s buyer’s remorse, don’t hesitate to reach out to me.
