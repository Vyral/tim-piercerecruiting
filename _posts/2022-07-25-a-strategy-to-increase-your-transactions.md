The market is changing quickly, and some agents are starting to feel the pressure on their pipeline. As we go through the market shift, what can you do to protect your income and remain competitive? I sat down with Ryan Holub, our Director of Operations, to share with us the strategy that has helped our real estate agents thrive despite the challenges in today's market.

**What's the biggest thing we teach our agents?&nbsp;**

One of the most important things we teach our team members is the concept of "The Pillars of Success." Essentially, the concept defines lead generation opportunities and identifies the sources of these opportunities. Some examples include open houses and social media. Knowing our Pillars of Success and how to increase them has helped us navigate the shifting market.

**What are other examples of pillars of success?**

Other examples include prospecting cold calling, networking with other industry professionals, and sphere of influence.&nbsp;

**Within your Pillars of Success, it's possible to have sub-pillars. For example, in your sphere of influence, you can implement a 36 Touch Plan or a client event appreciation event twice a year. Once you identify what your pillars are, what activities can you do to increase your chances of success?**

We believe in a life by design, not by default, so make sure that each pillar has measurables that you can track and action items to help you build your pillars successfully and consistently.&nbsp;

**How does that create more consistent income for an agent?**

Growing your pillars of success will bring more transactions. For example, you have four pillars, and out of those four, you get one transaction in July, and then you get more from your other pillars the next month. This will potentially lead to you having a more consistent pipeline.

Even in a shifting market, there's always an opportunity for significant growth. Take a hard look at your business and figure out how you can continue to succeed and thrive. If you want to learn more about the Pillars of Success or have any questions about the shifting market, don't hesitate to call or email me. I'm always happy to help\!
