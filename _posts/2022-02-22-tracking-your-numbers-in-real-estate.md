Which numbers should you track, and how should you track them? This is a really important subject for Realtors. If you don’t know your numbers, you don’t know where you could improve, and you don’t know where to invest in your business. It doesn’t matter if you’re selling six homes in a year or 1,000 homes, you have to know your numbers, and there are a couple of easy ways to track them.

**We use a couple of different systems on my team.** One is called [CTE](https://www.ctebiz.com/home){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, which stands for commitment to excellence. It’s only $29.99 a month, and it is essentially a spreadsheet on steroids. It’s very easy to set up. If you have an admin working for you, they could set it up and track all the necessary data. Recently, we upgraded to [Sisu](https://sisudata.com/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. It’s more powerful, but it is also significantly more expensive.&nbsp;

If you’re only selling a few houses a year and want to grow, you have to know your numbers. Track them on an Excel spreadsheet, if nothing else. **There are five things you need to track: set, met, signed, under contract, and closed.&nbsp;**

This is how you’re going to get better. If you’re really good at set and met but not so good at signed, you know where you need to improve and refine your skills. If you have any questions about how to track your numbers or what systems you should use, schedule a quick call with me. I’d be happy to talk about your numbers.
