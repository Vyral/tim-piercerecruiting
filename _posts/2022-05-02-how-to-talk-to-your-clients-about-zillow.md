I own a number of rental properties throughout our local market, and out of pure curiosity, I decided to see what Zillow’s online valuation tool, the Zestimate, said about two of my Bluffton Park properties’ values. These properties are nearly identical in size, view, fit, and finish.

**According to Zillow, the difference in value between the two properties was a substantial $128,000\!** That demonstrates the problems that can arise when we rely on robots to value real estate. There’s no replacement for a human being’s involvement in the process of pricing a home. Algorithms play an important role in giving you an *idea* of your home’s value, but they’re not the end-all-be-all of valuation.

So how do you respond if your buyer or seller tries to appeal to a Zestimate when you’re pricing their home? I’d recommend you pull up some data on Zillow and show them how flawed it is and explain why it’s so off. They can’t deny the information when you put it right in front of them in black and white.

If you have any more questions about this or other real estate topics, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to hear from you.
