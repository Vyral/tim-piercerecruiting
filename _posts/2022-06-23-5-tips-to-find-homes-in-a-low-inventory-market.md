Everyone is struggling to find inventory for their buyers. That's why I want to share five great tips for finding homes in a low-inventory market. They’re all simple and easy to implement right away.

**1\. Collaborate with other agents.** If you have a buyer who’s looking for a home in a specific market, pull up the recent sales in that area and find an agent who excels at selling properties there. Figure out if they have any inventory coming on the market.

**2\. Engage with your past clients.** Send them a market report or record a personalized video using an app like BombBomb. All you have to do is say you want to keep them up to date on their home values, include a quick CMA, add a link to recently sold homes, and ask them to stay in touch.

**3\. Pull a report from the MLS** of people who bought a home five to seven years ago. The average homeowner doesn’t stay put as long as you think, so these people might want to make a move. You can send a personalized note, call, or reach out to these homeowners in some way and find out if they’re interested in selling.

**4\. Call your past clients.** You can tell your past clients what your buyers are looking for and ask if they know anyone who’s looking to sell.

**5\. Send a list of your buyers’ needs to your past clients.** This is my favorite way to find inventory. You can make a list of your current buyers and what they’re looking for and send that list to your past clients, asking if they know anyone who’s looking to sell.

If you have any questions or would like some guidance through this process, feel free to call or email me. I would love to help.
