Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are crucial for you to consider in today’s real estate environment. Over the last several years, the difference between a 30-year mortgage and an ARM has been so negligible that people stopped talking about them. But now, that has changed. **The 30-year mortgage averaged around 4.86% recently, but a 5/1 ARM was just 3.35%.** That’s over a 1.5% difference in rate\!

When you’re dealing with a first-time homebuyer who is tight on cash and having a difficult time competing in this market, let them know that by using an ARM, they might be able to afford much more house. **What appears to be a small difference between rates can actually go a long way.**

As a consultant to your buyers, you need to be educated on all the options available to them. Figure out what their actual savings could be and how much more home they could afford if they used an ARM. Once you’ve done that, you can come up with a plan to help them beat their competition.
