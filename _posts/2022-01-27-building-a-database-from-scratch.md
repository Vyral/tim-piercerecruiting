How do you start building your database if you're a brand-new agent or if you're new to a given market?

My team is really good at getting brand new agents off the ground quickly and helping them build their databases. One of the exercises that we do is called “The Places That You Go.” We give them a worksheet with nine bubbles and five lines under each bubble. Think about all the different places you go in your week and list five people that you've engaged with there that you know could potentially refer you or provide other value. This is how you start building your database.

Then just start reaching out to them with regularity. It shouldn’t always be you asking them for business. You should also be offering something of value. Maybe they need a referral for a plumber or a handyman. **Offering value and building relationships will build your database.**

If you have any questions or want to schedule a call to talk about building your database, don’t hesitate to reach out to us via email or our website. We look forward to hearing from you.
