We all know that the housing market has been super hot over the past year, so what do industry experts think 2022 has in store for us? Here are three key predictions:

**1\. Mortgage rates are projected to rise.** Rates are and will continue to be historically low, so your buying power will still be incredibly high. However, we’ll probably see several rate hikes throughout the year.

**2\. Prices will continue to rise.** Inventory is historically low; it’s been said that we need about four million units nationwide to balance the market out. There’s just no way that we can satisfy that demand any time soon.

**3\. Home sales will continue to remain strong.** Given the continued lack of inventory and fierce demand, this is consistent with what we’ve seen over the last year.

If you have any questions about the market, give us a call or send an email. Let’s connect so that we can help you make your best move in 2022.
