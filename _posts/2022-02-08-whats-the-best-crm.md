{% include youtube.html %} {% include excerpt.html %} What's the best CRM to use in the real estate business, and how do you organize it? There’s almost no limit to the number of CRMs that you can choose from, and it can be overwhelming for agents. The most important thing to remember is that **the best CRM is the one that you will use**. On my team, we use Follow-Up Boss, but there are other CRMs like Hubspot, Command, Commissions Inc., and Boomtown.

Once you get a CRM set up, organize it quickly. I sort buyers and sellers into three different categories: A, B, and C. Category A are those likely to buy or sell in the next 30 days, B is within the next 30 to 90 days, and C is 90 days to six months. Build a plan around your CRM. There should be a call cadence and marketing plan for how you get in touch with these people.&nbsp;

If you need help organizing your CRM or have any other questions, visit my website, and don’t hesitate to reach out by phone or email to book a 15-minute call with me. I’d be happy to help you.
