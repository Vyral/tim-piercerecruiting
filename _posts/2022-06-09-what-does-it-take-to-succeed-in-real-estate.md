Did you know that 90% of agents don’t renew their licenses after their first year? If you’re new to the real estate business, you might be wondering what you need to do&nbsp; to be in the 10% who stay and find success. Here are three tips that will help new agents thrive in the industry:

**1\. Make sure you have a six-month financial reserve.** For your first 90 days in this business, you’ll be learning all about the industry, including the vocabulary and market data. Chances are you won’t make any sales in that period. Because sales don’t always close quickly, your first sale could be 45 days out even after those first 90 days. Given that, having a financial security blanket to lean on until you can start making sales is a smart move.

**2\. Treat your job like a career.** When you’re focused on your career, you’ll form a plan for your daily activities. Some days will go well, and some won’t—you need to have a structure in place that lets you pull through the tough times and forge ahead. You need to be disciplined and committed to this business. Too many people get into the industry and don’t treat it like a career because they’re so used to someone else holding them accountable.

**3\. Find a mentor.** It’s vital to have a mentor to help you pull through those difficult times and share their wisdom with you.

If you have any questions or would like more tips to help you build a solid foundation for your real estate career, give me a call or send me an email. I’d love to speak with you.
